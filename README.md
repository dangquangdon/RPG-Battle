# RPG Battle

## Description:  
This is a text-based game, served as a practicing project for new Python learners of The Shortcut's Python Course 2019.

## Installation:
- You only need to have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) downloaded and installed.
- Clone (or download) the repo  
```
git clone https://github.com/dangquangdon/RPG-Battle.git
```
- Navigate into the folder and run tha ```main2.py```  
```
cd RPG-Battle
python main2.py
```

## How to play:
- Read and follow the instructions in the game, but basically TRY TO KILL YOUR ENEMY
- There are probably bugs or errors that crash the game that I didn't foresee (because I'm noob maybe ^^!)
- If you input incorrect values, e.g characters in stead of numbers, you will miss your turn (I will probably fix it later)
- Once you've made decision, you won't be able to go back and choose again (sorry, that's life )
